            Iâ€™m writing to recommend Akinfolarin Ajayi for a software developer
            role. Folarin was among the top 3 best graduating students in a 5
            months full-stack web development training organized by Gomycode
            Nigeria. Akinfolarin did an exceptional job on his tasks and
            projects. He is a careful, proactive, self-motivated, and
            intelligent team player. It is also worthy to note that he had the
            2nd most outstanding project presentation on the Project Demo-day
            organized by Gomycode Nigeria. He will definitely be an exceptional
            asset to your organization. Please feel free to contact me at
            uzochukwunwigwe@gmail.com if you have any questions.
